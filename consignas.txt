To get a better understanding of your skills and the way you develop, we'd like
to ask you to complete a programming task (see below).

User Administration
Please implement a small Django application to manage (CRUD) users and their bank
account data (IBAN). Required fields are first name, last name and IBAN. Data should be validated.

* Administrators of the app should authenticate using a Google account
* Administrators should be able to create, read, update and delete users
* Restrict manipulation operations on a user to the administrator who created them
* Use PostgreSQL as the database backend
* Use Python 3.x
* Write documentation on how to setup, run and use your implementation

Test environment
Set up a virtual machine environment using vagrant
(provisioned by Puppet/Salt/Ansible/Bash - whatever suits you best)
or docker-compose to run the test task including some short documentation

Please build the application in small logical steps and commit each step to a Github
repository so that we can see how you approach the task. Make use of any libraries
and third party apps that you think might be of use here.
Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.
We prefer a clean and well thought solution over a fast one.
